If you are lonely when you're alone, you are in bad company.
It disturbs me no more to find men base, unjust, or selfish than to see apes mischievous, wolves savage, or the vulture ravenous.
She believed in nothing; only her skepticism kept her from being an atheist.
Generosity is nothing else than a craze to possess. All which I abandon, all which I give, I enjoy in a higher manner through the fact that I give it away. To give is to enjoy possessively the object which one gives.
There is only one day left, always starting over: it is given to us at dawn and taken away from us at dusk.
Life has no meaning the moment you lose the illusion of being eternal.
Freedom is what you do with what's been done to you.
Hell is other people.
Man is condemned to be free; because once thrown into the world, he is responsible for everything he does.
Everything has been figured out, except how to live.
Neither sex, without some fertilization of the complimentary characters of the other, is capable of the highest reaches of human endeavor.
If I became a philosopher, if I have so keenly sought this fame for which I'm still waiting, it's all been to seduce women basically.
Life begins on the other side of despair.
Every existing thing is born without reason, prolongs itself out of weakness, and dies by chance.
Like all dreamers, I mistook disenchantment for truth.
That God does not exist, I cannot deny, That my whole being cries out for God I cannot forget.
Total war is no longer war waged by all members of one national community against all those of another. It is total... because it may well involve the whole world.
Being is. Being is in-itself. Being is what it is.
Words are loaded pistols.
Evil is the product of the ability of humans to make abstract that which is concrete.
If a victory is told in detail, one can no longer distinguish it from a defeat.
As far as men go, it is not what they are that interests me, but what they can become.
Who can exhaust a man? Who knows a man's resources?
Commitment is an act, not a word.

The trouble with the world is that the stupid are cocksure and the intelligent are full of doubt.
The world is full of magical things patiently waiting for our wits to grow sharper.
To fear love is to fear life, and those who fear life are already three parts dead.
Men are born ignorant, not stupid. They are made stupid by education.
The only thing that will redeem mankind is cooperation.
The good life is one inspired by love and guided by knowledge.

Science is what you know, philosophy is what you don't know.
The time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time.
The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, and wiser people so full of doubts.
The fact that an opinion has been widely held is no evidence whatever that it is not utterly absurd.
I believe in using words, not fists. I believe in my outrage knowing people are living in boxes on the street. I believe in honesty. I believe in a good time. I believe in good food. I believe in sex.
A happy life must be to a great extent a quiet life, for it is only in an atmosphere of quiet that true joy dare live.
Those who have never known the deep intimacy and the intense companionship of mutual love have missed the best thing that life has to give.
I would never die for my beliefs because I might be wrong.
Extreme hopes are born from extreme misery.
Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind.
Life is nothing but a competition to be the criminal rather than the victim.
I say quite deliberately that the Christian religion, as organized in its Churches, has been and still is the principal enemy of moral progress in the world.
It is preoccupation with possessions, more than anything else, that prevents us from living freely and nobly.
Democracy is the process by which people choose the man who'll get the blame.
The secret to happiness is to face the fact that the world is horrible.
Do not fear to be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric.
The infliction of cruelty with a good conscience is a delight to moralists. That is why they invented Hell.
In America everybody is of the opinion that he has no social superiors, since all men are equal, but he does not admit that he has no social inferiors, for, from the time of Jefferson onward, the doctrine that all men are equal applies only upwards, not downwards.

Social progress can be measured by the social position of the female sex.
The theory of Communism may be summed up in one sentence: Abolish all private property.
The production of too many useful things results in too many useless people.
The meaning of peace is the absence of opposition to socialism.

Capital is dead labor, which, vampire-like, lives only by sucking living labor, and lives the more, the more labor it sucks.
Necessity is blind until it becomes conscious. Freedom is the consciousness of necessity.
Revolutions are the locomotives of history.
Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.

Amid the pressure of great events, a general principle gives no help.
I'm not ugly, but my beauty is a total creation.
The history of the world is none other than the progress of the consciousness of freedom.
When liberty is mentioned, we must always be careful to observe whether it is not really the assertion of private interests which is thereby designated.
Animals are in possession of themselves; their soul is in possession of their body. But they have no right to their life, because they do not will it.
Governments have never learned anything from history, or acted on principles deducted from it.
To him who looks upon the world rationally, the world in its turn presents a rational aspect. The relation is mutual.
The learner always begins by finding fault, but the scholar sees the positive merit in everything.
All that is real is reasonable, and all that is reasonable is real.
Mere goodness can achieve little against the power of nature.
Mark this well, you proud men of action! you are, after all, nothing but unconscious instruments of the men of thought.
It is easier to discover a deficiency in individuals, in states, and in Providence, than to see their real import and value.
Too fair to worship, too divine to love.
Truth in philosophy means that concept and external reality correspond.
Once the state has been founded, there can no longer be any heroes. They come on the scene only in uncivilized conditions.
World history is a court of judgment.
An idea is always a generalization, and generalization is a property of thinking. To generalize means to think.
The Few assume to be the deputies, but they are often only the despoilers of the Many.
Nothing great in the world has ever been accomplished without passion.
Genuine tragedies in the world are not conflicts between right and wrong. They are conflicts between two rights.

Agriculture is now a motorized food industry, the same thing in its essence as the production of corpses in the gas chambers and the extermination camps, the same thing as blockades and the reduction of countries to famine, the same thing as the manufacture of hydrogen bombs.
Time is not a thing, thus nothing which is, and yet it remains constant in its passing away without being something temporal like the beings in time.
If I take death into my life, acknowledge it, and face it squarely, I will free myself from the anxiety of death and the pettiness of life - and only then will I be free to become myself.
To dwell is to garden.
Thinking begins only when we have come to know that reason, glorified for centuries, is the stiff-necked adversary of thought.
The human being is not the lord of beings, but the shepherd of Being.
We do not say: Being is, time is, but rather: there is Being and there is time.
Being and time determine each other reciprocally, but in such a manner that neither can the former - Being - be addressed as something temporal nor can the latter - time - be addressed as a being.
The human body is essentially something other than an animal organism.
The possible ranks higher than the actual.
Being-alone is a deficient mode of being-with; its possibility is a proof for the latter.
Every man is born as many men and dies as a single one.
Man acts as though he were the shaper and master of language, while in fact language remains the master of man.
We name time when we say: every thing has its time. This means: everything which actually is, every being comes and goes at the right time and remains for a time during the time allotted to it. Every thing has its time.
The most thought-provoking thing in our thought-provoking time is that we are still not thinking.
Making itself intelligible is suicide for philosophy.
The Fuhrer alone is the present and future German reality and its law. Learn to know ever more deeply: from now on every single thing demands decision, and every action responsibility.
Language is the house of the truth of Being.
As the ego cogito, subjectivity is the consciousness that represents something, relates this representation back to itself, and so gathers with itself.
Man is not the lord of beings. Man is the shepherd of Being.
Time-space as commonly understood, in the sense of the distance measured between two time-points, is the result of time calculation.
The German language speaks Being, while all the others merely speak of Being.
Only a god can save us.
To think Being itself explicitly requires disregarding Being to the extent that it is only grounded and interpreted in terms of beings and for beings as their ground, as in all metaphysics.
Transcendence constitutes selfhood.
Whatever can be noted historically can be found within history.

There is nothing on this earth more to be prized than true friendship.
If the highest aim of a captain were to preserve his ship, he would keep it in port forever.
The things that we love tell us what we are.
Sorrow can be alleviated by good sleep, a bath and a glass of wine.
Good can exist without evil, whereas evil cannot exist without good.
To one who has faith, no explanation is necessary. To one without faith, no explanation is possible.
Three things are necessary for the salvation of man: to know what he ought to believe; to know what he ought to desire; and to know what he ought to do.
We can't have full knowledge all at once. We must start by believing; then afterwards we may be led on to master the evidence for ourselves.
Better to illuminate than merely to shine, to deliver to others contemplated truths than merely to contemplate.
Friendship is the source of the greatest pleasures, and without friends even the most agreeable pursuits become tedious.
To bear with patience wrongs done to oneself is a mark of perfection, but to bear with patience wrongs done to someone else is a mark of imperfection and even of actual sin.
Wonder is the desire for knowledge.
How can we live in harmony? First we need to know we are all madly in love with the same God.
By nature all men are equal in liberty, but not in other endowments.
Love takes up where knowledge leaves off.
Three conditions are necessary for Penance: contrition, which is sorrow for sin, together with a purpose of amendment; confession of sins without any omission; and satisfaction by means of good works.
Because of the diverse conditions of humans, it happens that some acts are virtuous to some people, as appropriate and suitable to them, while the same acts are immoral for others, as inappropriate to them.
It is requisite for the relaxation of the mind that we make use, from time to time, of playful deeds and jokes.
Temperance is simply a disposition of the mind which binds the passion.
The test of the artist does not lie in the will with which he goes to work, but in the excellence of the work he produces.
To live well is to work well, to show a good activity.
Love is a binding force, by which another is joined to me and cherished by myself.
Well-ordered self-love is right and natural.
If, then, you are looking for the way by which you should go, take Christ, because He Himself is the way.
Because philosophy arises from awe, a philosopher is bound in his way to be a lover of myths and poetic fables. Poets and philosophers are alike in being big with wonder.
Faith has to do with things that are not seen and hope with things that are not at hand.

The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant.
If all mankind minus one were of one opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind.
I have learned to seek my happiness by limiting my desires, rather than in attempting to satisfy them.
He who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that.
The disease which inflicts bureaucracy and what they usually die from is routine.
All desirable things... are desirable either for the pleasure inherent in themselves, or as a means to the promotion of pleasure and the prevention of pain.
The most cogent reason for restricting the interference of government is the great evil of adding unnecessarily to its power.
The general tendency of things throughout the world is to render mediocrity the ascendant power among mankind.
War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things. The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse.
Of two pleasures, if there be one which all or almost all who have experience of both give a decided preference, irrespective of any feeling of moral obligation to prefer it, that is the more desirable pleasure.
That so few now dare to be eccentric, marks the chief danger of the time.
The only power deserving the name is that of masses, and of governments while they make themselves the organ of the tendencies and instincts of masses.
A man who has nothing for which he is willing to fight, nothing which is more important than his own personal safety, is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself.
The only freedom which deserves the name is that of pursuing our own good, in our own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs, or impede their efforts to obtain it.
The amount of eccentricity in a society has generally been proportional to the amount of genius, mental vigor, and moral courage it contained. That so few now dare to be eccentric marks the chief danger of the time.
One person with a belief is equal to ninety-nine who have only interests.
Conservatives are not necessarily stupid, but most stupid people are conservatives.
A person may cause evil to others not only by his actions but by his inaction, and in either case he is justly accountable to them for the injury.
Actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness; wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. By happiness is intended pleasure and the absence of pain.
All political revolutions, not affected by foreign conquest, originate in moral revolutions. The subversion of established institutions is merely one consequence of the previous subversion of established opinions.
In all intellectual debates, both sides tend to be correct in what they affirm, and wrong in what they deny.
It is questionable if all the mechanical inventions yet made have lightened the day's toil of any human being.
Life has a certain flavor for those who have fought and risked all that the sheltered and protected can never experience.
The only part of the conduct of any one, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.

Man was born free, and he is everywhere in chains.
We are born weak, we need strength; helpless, we need aid; foolish, we need reason. All that we lack at birth, all that we need when we come to man's estate, is the gift of education.

There are forms of oppression and domination which become invisible - the new normal.
This non-proletarianised plebs has been racialist when it has been colonialist; it has been nationalist - chauvinist - when it has been armed; and it has been fascist when it has become the police force.These ideological effects on the plebs have been uncontestable and profound.
Discipline may be identified neither with an institution nor with an apparatus; it is a type of power, a modality for its exercise, comprising a whole set of instruments, techniques, procedures, levels of application, targets; it is a 'physics' or 'anatomy' of power, a technology.
Power is not an institution, and not a structure; neither is it a certain strength we are endowed with; it is the name that one attributes to a complex strategical situation in a particular society.
Freedom of conscience entails more dangers than authority and despotism.
Madness is the absolute break with the work of art; it forms the constitutive moment of abolition, which dissolves in time the truth of the work of art.
The problem of Islam as a political force is an essential one for our time and for the years to come, and we cannot approach it with a modicum of intelligence if we start out from a position of hatred.
The history of thought, of knowledge, of philosophy, of literature seems to be seeking, and discovering, more and more discontinuities, whereas history itself appears to be abandoning the irruption of events in favor of stable structures.
Prison is a recruitment center for the army of crime. That is what it achieves.
Knowledge doesn't really form part of human nature. Conflict, combat, the outcome of the combat, and, consequently, risk and chance are what gives rise to knowledge. Knowledge is not instinctive; it is counter instinctive, just as it is not natural but counter natural.
We are in the society of the teacher-judge, the doctor-judge, the educator-judge, the 'social-worker'-judge; it is on them that the universal reign of the normative is based; and each individual, wherever he may find himself, subjects to it his body, his gestures, his behavior, his aptitudes, his achievements.
Penal law was not created by the common people, nor by the peasantry, nor by the proletariat, but entirely by the bourgeoisie as an important tactical weapon in this system of divisions which they wished to introduce.
In its function, the power to punish is not essentially different from that of curing or educating.
The strategic adversary is fascism... the fascism in us all, in our heads and in our everyday behavior, the fascism that causes us to love power, to desire the very thing that dominates and exploits us.
If repression has indeed been the fundamental link between power, knowledge, and sexuality since the classical age, it stands to reason that we will not be able to free ourselves from it except at a considerable cost.
As the archaeology of our thought easily shows, man is an invention of recent date. And one perhaps nearing its end.
Prison continues, on those who are entrusted to it, a work begun elsewhere, which the whole of society pursues on each individual through innumerable mechanisms of discipline.
In political and social analysis, we still have not cut off the head of the king.
For the bourgeoisie, the main danger against which it had to be protected, that which had to be avoided at all costs, was armed uprising, was the armed people, was the workers taking to the streets in an assault against the government.
The book is not simply the object that one holds in one's hands, and it cannot remain within the little parallelpiped that contains it: its unity is variable and relative. As soon as one questions that unity, it loses its self-evidence; it indicates itself, constructs itself, only on the basis of a complex field of discourse.
What strikes me is the fact that in our society, art has become something which is only related to objects, and not to individuals, or to life.
Justice must always question itself, just as society can exist only by means of the work it does on itself and on its institutions.
It is often said that definitions of Islamic government are imprecise. To me, however, they seemed to have a clarity that was completely familiar and also, it must be said, far from reassuring.
My hypothesis is not so much that the court is the natural expression of popular justice, but rather that its historical function is to ensnare it, to control it and strangle it, by re-inscribing it within institutions which are typical of a state apparatus.
The frontiers of a book are never clear-cut: beyond the title, the first lines, and the last full stop, beyond its internal configuration and its autonomous form, it is caught up in a system of references to other books, other texts, other sentences: it is a node within a network.

It is often said that definitions of Islamic government are imprecise. To me, however, they seemed to have a clarity that was completely familiar and also, it must be said, far from reassuring.
My hypothesis is not so much that the court is the natural expression of popular justice, but rather that its historical function is to ensnare it, to control it and strangle it, by re-inscribing it within institutions which are typical of a state apparatus.
The frontiers of a book are never clear-cut: beyond the title, the first lines, and the last full stop, beyond its internal configuration and its autonomous form, it is caught up in a system of references to other books, other texts, other sentences: it is a node within a network.
There are forms of oppression and domination which become invisible - the new normal.
This non-proletarianised plebs has been racialist when it has been colonialist; it has been nationalist - chauvinist - when it has been armed; and it has been fascist when it has become the police force.These ideological effects on the plebs have been uncontestable and profound.
Discipline may be identified neither with an institution nor with an apparatus; it is a type of power, a modality for its exercise, comprising a whole set of instruments, techniques, procedures, levels of application, targets; it is a 'physics' or 'anatomy' of power, a technology.
Power is not an institution, and not a structure; neither is it a certain strength we are endowed with; it is the name that one attributes to a complex strategical situation in a particular society.
Freedom of conscience entails more dangers than authority and despotism.
Madness is the absolute break with the work of art; it forms the constitutive moment of abolition, which dissolves in time the truth of the work of art.
The problem of Islam as a political force is an essential one for our time and for the years to come, and we cannot approach it with a modicum of intelligence if we start out from a position of hatred.
The history of thought, of knowledge, of philosophy, of literature seems to be seeking, and discovering, more and more discontinuities, whereas history itself appears to be abandoning the irruption of events in favor of stable structures.
Prison is a recruitment center for the army of crime. That is what it achieves.
Knowledge doesn't really form part of human nature. Conflict, combat, the outcome of the combat, and, consequently, risk and chance are what gives rise to knowledge. Knowledge is not instinctive; it is counter instinctive, just as it is not natural but counter natural.
We are in the society of the teacher-judge, the doctor-judge, the educator-judge, the 'social-worker'-judge; it is on them that the universal reign of the normative is based; and each individual, wherever he may find himself, subjects to it his body, his gestures, his behavior, his aptitudes, his achievements.
Penal law was not created by the common people, nor by the peasantry, nor by the proletariat, but entirely by the bourgeoisie as an important tactical weapon in this system of divisions which they wished to introduce.
In its function, the power to punish is not essentially different from that of curing or educating.
The strategic adversary is fascism... the fascism in us all, in our heads and in our everyday behavior, the fascism that causes us to love power, to desire the very thing that dominates and exploits us.
If repression has indeed been the fundamental link between power, knowledge, and sexuality since the classical age, it stands to reason that we will not be able to free ourselves from it except at a considerable cost.
As the archaeology of our thought easily shows, man is an invention of recent date. And one perhaps nearing its end.
Prison continues, on those who are entrusted to it, a work begun elsewhere, which the whole of society pursues on each individual through innumerable mechanisms of discipline.
In political and social analysis, we still have not cut off the head of the king.
For the bourgeoisie, the main danger against which it had to be protected, that which had to be avoided at all costs, was armed uprising, was the armed people, was the workers taking to the streets in an assault against the government.
The book is not simply the object that one holds in one's hands, and it cannot remain within the little parallelpiped that contains it: its unity is variable and relative. As soon as one questions that unity, it loses its self-evidence; it indicates itself, constructs itself, only on the basis of a complex field of discourse.

Only crime and the criminal, it is true, confront us with the perplexity of radical evil; but only the hypocrite is really rotten to the core.
This is the precept by which I have lived: Prepare for the worst; expect the best; and take what comes.
The trouble with lying and deceiving is that their efficiency depends entirely upon a clear notion of the truth that the liar and deceiver wishes to hide.
The sad truth is that most evil is done by people who never make up their minds to be good or evil.
Storytelling reveals meaning without committing the error of defining it.
Death not merely ends life, it also bestows upon it a silent completeness, snatched from the hazardous flux to which all things human are subject.
There are no dangerous thoughts; thinking itself is dangerous.
Forgiveness is the key to action and freedom.
Promises are the uniquely human way of ordering the future, making it predictable and reliable to the extent that this is humanly possible.

In order to go on living one must try to escape the death involved in perfectionism.
Only the mob and the elite can be attracted by the momentum of totalitarianism itself. The masses have to be won by propaganda.
Where all are guilty, no one is; confessions of collective guilt are the best possible safeguard against the discovery of culprits, and the very magnitude of the crime the best excuse for doing nothing.
Revolutionaries do not make revolutions. The revolutionaries are those who know when power is lying in the street and then they can pick it up.
By its very nature the beautiful is isolated from everything else. From beauty no road leads to reality.
The more dubious and uncertain an instrument violence has become in international relations, the more it has gained in reputation and appeal in domestic affairs, specifically in the matter of revolution.
Power and violence are opposites; where the one rules absolutely, the other is absent. Violence appears where power is in jeopardy, but left to its own course it ends in power's disappearance.
For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.

Economic growth may one day turn out to be a curse rather than a good, and under no conditions can it either lead into freedom or constitute a proof for its existence.
No punishment has ever possessed enough power of deterrence to prevent the commission of crimes. On the contrary, whatever the punishment, once a specific crime has appeared for the first time, its reappearance is more likely than its initial emergence could ever have been.

Both old and young alike ought to seek wisdom: the former in order that, as age comes over him, he may be young in good things because of the grace of what has been, and the latter in order that, while he is young, he may at the same time be old, because he has no fear of the things which are to come.

There is no such thing as justice in the abstract; it is merely a compact between men.
Justice... is a kind of compact not to harm or be harmed.
Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for.
Death does not concern us, because as long as we exist, death is not here. And when it does come, we no longer exist.
Not what we have But what we enjoy, constitutes our abundance.
It is not so much our friends' help that helps us, as the confidence of their help.
The time when most of you should withdraw into yourself is when you are forced to be in a crowd.
It is better for you to be free of fear lying upon a pallet, than to have a golden couch and a rich table and be full of trouble.

Justice... is a kind of compact not to harm or be harmed.
It is not wisdom but Authority that makes a law.
The condition of man... is a condition of war of everyone against everyone.
The right of nature... is the liberty each man hath to use his own power, as he will himself, for the preservation of his own nature; that is to say, of his own life.
Curiosity is the lust of the mind.
The obligation of subjects to the sovereign is understood to last as long, and no longer, than the power lasteth by which he is able to protect them.
During the time men live without a common power to keep them all in awe, they are in that conditions called war; and such a war, as if of every man, against every man.
Such is the nature of men, that howsoever they may acknowledge many others to be more witty, or more eloquent, or more learned; yet they will hardly believe there be many so wise as themselves.
I put for the general inclination of all mankind, a perpetual and restless desire of power after power, that ceaseth only in death.
That a man be willing, when others are so too, as far forth as for peace and defense of himself he shall think it necessary, to lay down this right to all things; and be contented with so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself.
He that is taken and put into prison or chains is not conquered, though overcome; for he is still an enemy.
Words are the money of fools.
In the state of nature profit is the measure of right.
I am about to take my last voyage, a great leap in the dark.
There is no such thing as perpetual tranquillity of mind while we live here; because life itself is but motion, and can never be without desire, nor without fear, no more than without sense.
The privilege of absurdity; to which no living creature is subject, but man only.
Not believing in force is the same as not believing in gravitation.
They that approve a private opinion, call it opinion; but they that dislike it, heresy; and yet heresy signifies no more than private opinion.
All generous minds have a horror of what are commonly called 'Facts'. They are the brute beasts of the intellectual domain.
When all the world is overcharged with inhabitants, then the last remedy of all is war, which provideth for every man, by victory or death.
A wise man should so write (though in words understood by all men) that wise men only should be able to commend him.
A man cannot lay down the right of resisting them that assault him by force, to take away his life.
Understanding is nothing else than conception caused by speech.
Fear of things invisible in the natural seed of that which everyone in himself calleth religion.
Sudden glory is the passion which maketh those grimaces called laughter.
Prudence is but experience, which equal time, equally bestows on all men, in those things they equally apply themselves unto.
The Papacy is not other than the Ghost of the deceased Roman Empire, sitting crowned upon the grave thereof.

The greatest weapon against stress is our ability to choose one thought over another.
Pessimism leads to weakness, optimism to power.
Believe that life is worth living and your belief will help create the fact.
The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.
It is our attitude at the beginning of a difficult task which, more than anything else, will affect its successful outcome.
Act as if what you do makes a difference. It does.

The aim of a college education is to teach you to know a good man when you see one.
A chain is no stronger than its weakest link, and life is after all a chain.
Whenever you're in conflict with someone, there is one factor that can make the difference between damaging your relationship and deepening it. That factor is attitude.
Time itself comes in drops.
The greatest discovery of my generation is that a human being can alter his life by altering his attitudes.
Success or failure depends more upon attitude than upon capacity successful men act as though they have accomplished or are enjoying something. Soon it becomes a reality. Act, look, feel successful, conduct yourself accordingly, and you will be amazed at the positive results.
A great many people think they are thinking when they are merely rearranging their prejudices.
Begin to be now what you will be hereafter.
If you care enough for a result, you will most certainly attain it.
The sway of alcohol over mankind is unquestionably due to its power to stimulate the mystical faculties of human nature, usually crushed to earth by the cold facts and dry criticisms of the sober hour.
Nothing is so fatiguing as the eternal hanging on of an uncompleted task.
Belief creates the actual fact.
There is no more miserable human being than one in whom nothing is habitual but indecision.
There is but one cause of human failure. And that is man's lack of faith in his true Self.
Human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind.
Our normal waking consciousness, rational consciousness as we call it, is but one special type of consciousness, whilst all about it, parted from it by the filmiest of screens, there lie potential forms of consciousness entirely different.
If you want a quality, act as if you already had it.

The sovereign cure for worry is prayer.
Prayer does not change God, but it changes him who prays.
The tyrant dies and his rule is over, the martyr dies and his rule begins.
Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.
Don't forget to love yourself.
People demand freedom of speech as a compensation for the freedom of thought which they seldom use.
Life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced.
Our life always expresses the result of our dominant thoughts.
Be that self which one truly is.
Once you label me you negate me.
Boredom is the root of all evil - the despairing refusal to be oneself.
Love is all, it gives all, and it takes all.
Face the facts of being what you are, for that is what changes what you are.
Most men pursue pleasure with such breathless haste that they hurry past it.
I see it all perfectly; there are two possible situations - one can either do this or that. My honest opinion and my friendly advice is this: do it or do not do it - you will regret both.
The highest and most beautiful things in life are not to be heard about, nor read about, nor seen but, if one will, are to be lived.
To dare is to lose one's footing momentarily. Not to dare is to lose oneself.
Just as in earthly life lovers long for the moment when they are able to breathe forth their love for each other, to let their souls blend in a soft whisper, so the mystic longs for the moment when in prayer he can, as it were, creep into God.
Patience is necessary, and one cannot reap immediately where one has sown.
Purity of heart is to will one thing.
Old age realizes the dreams of youth: look at Dean Swift; in his youth he built an asylum for the insane, in his old age he was himself an inmate.
One can advise comfortably from a safe port.
Marriage brings one into fatal connection with custom and tradition, and traditions and customs are like the wind and weather, altogether incalculable.
Life has its own hidden forces which you can only discover by living.
Since boredom advances and boredom is the root of all evil, no wonder, then, that the world goes backwards, that evil spreads. This can be traced back to the very beginning of the world. The gods were bored; therefore they created human beings.
There is nothing with which every man is so afraid as getting to know how enormously much he is capable of doing and becoming.
At the bottom of enmity between strangers lies indifference.
Prayer does not change God, but it changes him who prays.
The tyrant dies and his rule is over, the martyr dies and his rule begins.

Patience is necessary, and one cannot reap immediately where one has sown.
Purity of heart is to will one thing.
Old age realizes the dreams of youth: look at Dean Swift; in his youth he built an asylum for the insane, in his old age he was himself an inmate.
One can advise comfortably from a safe port.
Marriage brings one into fatal connection with custom and tradition, and traditions and customs are like the wind and weather, altogether incalculable.
Life has its own hidden forces which you can only discover by living.
Since boredom advances and boredom is the root of all evil, no wonder, then, that the world goes backwards, that evil spreads. This can be traced back to the very beginning of the world. The gods were bored; therefore they created human beings.
There is nothing with which every man is so afraid as getting to know how enormously much he is capable of doing and becoming.
At the bottom of enmity between strangers lies indifference.
Prayer does not change God, but it changes him who prays.
The tyrant dies and his rule is over, the martyr dies and his rule begins.
Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.
Don't forget to love yourself.
People demand freedom of speech as a compensation for the freedom of thought which they seldom use.
Life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced.
Our life always expresses the result of our dominant thoughts.
Be that self which one truly is.
Once you label me you negate me.
Boredom is the root of all evil - the despairing refusal to be oneself.
Love is all, it gives all, and it takes all.
Face the facts of being what you are, for that is what changes what you are.
Most men pursue pleasure with such breathless haste that they hurry past it.
I see it all perfectly; there are two possible situations - one can either do this or that. My honest opinion and my friendly advice is this: do it or do not do it - you will regret both.
The highest and most beautiful things in life are not to be heard about, nor read about, nor seen but, if one will, are to be lived.

Change your life today. Don't gamble on the future, act now, without delay.
I wish that every human life might be pure transparent freedom.
One's life has value so long as one attributes value to the life of others, by means of love, friendship, indignation and compassion.
One is not born a woman, but becomes one.
Society cares for the individual only so far as he is profitable.
I am incapable of conceiving infinity, and yet I do not accept finity.
In the face of an obstacle which is impossible to overcome, stubbornness is stupid.
Sex pleasure in woman is a kind of magic spell; it demands complete abandon; if words or movements oppose the magic of caresses, the spell is broken.
Life is occupied in both perpetuating itself and in surpassing itself; if all it does is maintain itself, then living is only not dying.
If you live long enough, you'll see that every victory turns into a defeat.
Representation of the world, like the world itself, is the work of men; they describe it from their own point of view, which they confuse with the absolute truth.
All oppression creates a state of war.
I tore myself away from the safe comfort of certainties through my love for truth - and truth rewarded me.
In itself, homosexuality is as limiting as heterosexuality: the ideal should be to be capable of loving a woman or a man; either, a human being, without feeling fear, restraint, or obligation.
All the idols made by man, however terrifying they may be, are in point of fact subordinate to him, and that is why he will always have it in his power to destroy them.
No one is more arrogant toward women, more aggressive or scornful, than the man who is anxious about his virility.
Retirement may be looked upon either as a prolonged holiday or as a rejection, a being thrown on to the scrap-heap.
One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman.
Why one man rather than another? It was odd. You find yourself involved with a fellow for life just because he was the one that you met when you were nineteen.
Society, being codified by man, decrees that woman is inferior; she can do away with this inferiority only by destroying the male's superiority.
To catch a husband is an art; to hold him is a job.
The word love has by no means the same sense for both sexes, and this is one cause of the serious misunderstandings that divide them.
The writer of originality, unless dead, is always shocking, scandalous; novelty disturbs and repels.
It is not in giving life but in risking life that man is raised above the animal; that is why superiority has been accorded in humanity not to the sex that brings forth but to that which kills.
What is an adult? A child blown up by age.
The most mediocre of males feels himself a demigod as compared with women.

Education is not preparation for life; education is life itself.
Arriving at one goal is the starting point to another.
Every great advance in science has issued from a new audacity of imagination.
Education, therefore, is a process of living and not a preparation for future living.
Just as a flower which seems beautiful and has color but no perfume, so are the fruitless words of the man who speaks them but does them not.
Skepticism: the mark and even the pose of the educated mind.
Time and memory are true artists; they remould reality nearer to the heart's desire.
The self is not something ready-made, but something in continuous formation through choice of action.
The good man is the man who, no matter how morally unworthy he has been, is moving to become better.
To find out what one is fitted to do, and to secure an opportunity to do it, is the key to happiness.
Failure is instructive. The person who really thinks learns quite as much from his failures as from his successes.
The belief that all genuine education comes about through experience does not mean that all experiences are genuinely or equally educative.
Such happiness as life is capable of comes from the full participation of all our powers in the endeavor to wrest from each changing situations of experience its own full and unique meaning.
We only think when we are confronted with problems.
Man is not logical and his intellectual history is a record of mental reserves and compromises. He hangs on to what he can in his old beliefs even when he is compelled to surrender their logical basis.
To me faith means not worrying.
Nature is the mother and the habitat of man, even if sometimes a stepmother and an unfriendly home.
Man lives in a world of surmise, of mystery, of uncertainties.
The path of least resistance and least trouble is a mental rut already made. It requires troublesome work to undertake the alternation of old beliefs.
Anyone who has begun to think, places some portion of the world in jeopardy.
No man's credit is as good as his money.
Without some goals and some efforts to reach it, no man can live.
By object is meant some element in the complex whole that is defined in abstraction from the whole of which it is a distinction.
Luck, bad if not good, will always be with us. But it has a way of favoring the intelligent and showing its back to the stupid.
One lives with so many bad deeds on one's conscience and some good intentions in one's heart.

There is nothing permanent except change.
No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man.
Big results require big ambitions.
Hide our ignorance as we will, an evening of wine soon reveals it.
Good character is not formed in a week or a month. It is created little by little, day by day. Protracted and patient effort is needed to develop good character.
